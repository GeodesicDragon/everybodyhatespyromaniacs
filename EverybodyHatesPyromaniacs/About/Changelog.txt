Version 1.2.3 (March 20th 2022)

* Corrected error in description saying that the opinion loss is -25 when it's actually -20.

Version 1.2.2 (March 20th 2022)

* Added patch which sets the commonality of the Pyromaniac trait to 0.1, making it less common to encounter.
* The Better Pyromania mod created by Aelanna overhauls the Pyromaniac trait to be less destructive, whereas this mod is designed to work with (against?) the vanilla version. As such, I've added in a warning that this mod is not compatible with Aelanna's.
* Reduced opinion loss from -100 to -20 because it was too easy to get +10 mood buffs from killing pyromaniac pawns.

Version 1.0.1 (January 16th 2022)

* Initial Release.
